# # Pattern: distributed objects
# 
# Remote objects:
# - distributed shared-memory object store
# - think: passing variables across the cluster
# - Ray will do object spilling to disk if needed
# 
# In Ray, we can create and compute on objects. We refer to these objects as remote objects, and we use object refs to refer to them. Remote objects are stored in shared-memory object stores, and there is one object store per node in the cluster. In the cluster setting, we may not actually know which machine each object lives on.
# 
# An object ref is essentially a unique ID that can be used to refer to a remote object. If youâ€™re familiar with futures, our object refs are conceptually similar.
# 
# Object refs can be created in multiple ways:
# - by remote function calls
# - by `ray.put()`
