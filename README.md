# Ray Learning

This is a collection of learning resources for the [Ray](https://ray.readthedocs.io/) framework.

It is primarily structured as a [Jupyter book](https://jupyterbook.org/intro.html), but also includes some deployable projects found in the `tutorials` directory.

## Python setup

In order to build the Jupyter book, run the cells or the tutorials, you will need a Python environment with required dependencies. These are documented [here](book/python_setup.md).
